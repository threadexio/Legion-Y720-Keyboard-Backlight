Simple C program to control the keyboard backlight on the Lenovo Legion Y720 (should probably work on other laptops with the same keyboard)

It's literally [this](https://github.com/Izurii/Lenovo-Y720-KB-Led-Controller) but written in C without a GUI for the minimalists and purists

## Features
<hr>

- Unlimited profiles
- Easy-ish configuration
- No GUI (terminal ftw)
- Written in C

## ‚û° üèóÔ∏è Build
<hr>

```bash
$ make
...
```
- Binary can be found in `build/release/kbd-backlight`

## ‚û° ‚ú® Install
<hr>

```bash
$ sudo make install
...
```
- Binary path is `/usr/local/bin/kbd-backlight`
- Configuration path is `/etc/kbd-backlight/backlight.conf`

**NOTE:** Any user that should be able to control the backlight should be added to the `kbd-backlight` group (`gpasswd -a [USER] kbd-backlight`)


We now have an AppArmor profile for the binary, to install it do this instead of the above
```bash
$ sudo make install apparmor
...

$ sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.local.bin.kbd-backlight
```

## Usage
--------
```bash
$ kbd-backlight

Usage: kbd-backlight [profile name] {config file}
```

`{config file}`: Specify another location for the config file (Optional)

Each user, who is in the `kbd-backlight` group, can now have their own personal config file with their own custom profiles. This config file must be manually created by the user with this command:
```bash
$ cp /usr/share/kbd-backlight/backlight.conf.default ~/.config/kbd-backlight.conf
```
The executable will automagically detect whether the user has their own config and load that instead of the system-wide one
